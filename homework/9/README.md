Me: Can you use Chinese to response?
Ans:  🙏

Yes, I can respond in Chinese. I can understand and respond in Simplified Chinese (/) and 
Traditional Chinese (/). Please feel free to ask me any questions or give me any commands 
in Chinese.

(Please note that I'm a machine learning model, and while I can understand and respond in 
Chinese, my proficiency may not be entirely native-like.)

Me: 台大在哪裡?
Ans:  National Taiwan University (台大) is located in Taipei City, the capital of Taiwan. 
The university's main campus is situated on Xinsheng South Road in Da’an District, Taipei. The address is:

台北市大安區新生南路1號

That's approximately a 5-minute walk from Taipei City Hall MRT Station ( Taipei Metro Line 1 and Line 3) or Zhongxiao Xinsheng MRT Station (Taipei Metro Line 1 and Line 3) on the same line.
