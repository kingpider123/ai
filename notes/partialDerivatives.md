# Partial Derivative
 In mathematics, a partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant (as opposed to the total derivative, in which all variables are allowed to vary). Partial derivatives are used in vector calculus and differential geometry.
## Example: 
* ## $f(x,y)=x^2 +xy +y^2$
* ## Partial derivative for x: $2x+y$
* ## Partial derivative for y: $x+2y$

# Gradient
In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function 
𝑓 of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) 
∇𝑓 whose value at a point 𝑝
gives the direction and the rate of fastest increase
## The gradient is the vector formed by the partial differentiation of each variable
## Example:
* ## $f(x,y)=x^2 +xy +y^2$
* ## $grad = [2x+y,x+2y]$
* ## Gradient of f at (1,2) = [4,5]
