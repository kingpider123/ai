# Reinforcement learning:
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behavior in an environment to obtain maximum reward. This optimal behavior is learned through interactions with the environment and observations of how it responds, similar to children exploring the world around them and learning the actions that help them achieve a goal.

# Q-learning:
Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state
